          <h2 class="t1">About the Jewish Play Project</h2>
          <h2 class="t2">How this got started</h2>

          <p>This site grew out of research work begun by Professor Jacobs in the summer of 2014. He was acting as a subject matter expert for Rabbi Robert Morais, who at that time was the Director of the Shalom Street Museum in the Metro Detroit’s JCC.  They were working on the exhibit Across the Board: From Dreidel to XBOX. The toys and games of the Jewish People that ran from 2014-2015.</p>

          <p>While the “Hall of Fame” for the exhibit was to showcase 8-10 leaders in the field,  it became clear to Professor Jacobs that there was a much larger story to tell than the exhibit itself could support and so the idea for the Jewish Play Project website was born. The Jewish Play Project is supported by the Center for Media, Art, Games, Interaction and Creativity (MAGIC) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>

          <p>Professor Jacobs will be on Sabbatical for the Spring semester of 2020 to complete a book tentatively titled “Stories from the Jewish Play Project."</p>

          <h2 class="t2">Why it’s on-line now even though its not “finished.”</h2>
          <p>First, this topic covers hundreds of people and companies and potentially thousands of toys since the 1800s.  There’s opportunity here for decades worth of collaborative scholarly work across numerous institutions.  It will be a long time before these efforts are “finished.”</p>
          <p>Second, we believe in Open Source and Free Content (RIT has the first academic minor in the topic)  The philosophy of those communities is to get work out into the community as soon as possible to encourage collaboration.</p>
          <p>
            Third, many of our initial discoveries, and this current web site, would not be possible without the World Wide Web; a technology created to encourage dissemination of pre-publication work to encourage knowledge sharing. It seems only right to make this information public as early as possible.
